# Functions

## Local Variables

- `static int counter` : a static variable called counter is declared. If it is declared inside a function and we do `counter++`, and call the function multiple times, then the counter will get incremented. (check `functions.cpp`)
- `static` variable, a single, statically allocated object represent that variables in all calls.
